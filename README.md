# Moving Average Crossover Strategy with LSTM

Welcome to the **Moving Average Crossover Strategy with LSTM** project! This repository implements a trading strategy that combines the classic Moving Average Crossover technique with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict price trends and optimize trading signals. The goal is to enhance traditional technical analysis with machine learning for better decision-making in financial markets.

## Project Overview
The Moving Average Crossover Strategy is a popular trend-following approach that generates buy and sell signals based on the crossover of short-term and long-term moving averages. This project enhances the strategy by using an LSTM model to predict future price movements, which are then used to refine the crossover signals. By integrating machine learning, the project aims to reduce false signals and improve profitability in volatile markets.

This project is ideal for:
- Traders exploring machine learning in algorithmic trading.
- Data scientists interested in financial time series forecasting.
- Developers building predictive trading systems.

## Features
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines traditional moving average crossover with LSTM-based price predictions.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust moving average periods, LSTM architecture, and trading rules.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles financial time series data with scaling and sequence generation for LSTM.
- **Backtesting**: Evaluates strategy performance with historical data.
- **Visualization**: Plots price trends, moving averages, trading signals, and portfolio growth.
- **Extensible**: Easily integrate additional indicators or models.
